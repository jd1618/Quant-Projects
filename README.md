# Quant Projects

Having experienced several quantitative research and trading interviews, I have engaged with many interesting problems and projects that have challenged me to think creatively and apply my mathematical and programming abilities. 
This repository is a place where I share my solutions to various problems, as well as data projects for more open-ended problems. In most cases, I provide both analytical or asymptotic solutions, and testing my solutions through Monte Carlo simulations.
